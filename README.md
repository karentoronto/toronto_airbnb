## Project Description ##
### This project analyzes the Airbnb rental market in Toronto for a prospective client seeking to purchase a propery for Airbnb rental. The analysis will be presented in the form of an interactive Tableau storyboard showcasing the results of an exploratory analysis in Python.  

## **Details of the data source(s)**
### **Dataset:** http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data

### The dataset is sourced from a website called “Inside Airbnb”, a non-profit group that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb’s impact on residential communities. The goal of the organization is to empower communities with data and information to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists.  This information covers Toronto, Ontario. The data source does not appear to be affiliated with Airbnb itself. It is web scraped data from Airbnb organized into a dataset. Since this is not a direct source of the data and their methodology of extracting the data is unknown, there may be some questions as to the reliability of this data. 

### Data covers Airbnb rentals in Toronto. The description is provided below.


## Research questions
### Which neighborhoods in Toronto command the highest Airbnb rental prices in Toronto?
### What are the factors driving the price of an Airnbnb rental in Toronto?

## Cleaning procedures
### Several methods were used in cleaning the initial dataset. Variables deemed insignificant were removed. One way to deal with missing values was imputation with the median value. For one variable missing a significant percentage of values, it was discovered that these occurred in the timeframe before 2015. The dataset was thus pared down to the timeframe between January 2015 to January 2024 so that subset of the data did not contain any missing values.
